## Description
The purpose of this project was to build a functional, NoSQL database utilizing MongoDB and Mongoose. In addition to this I created a functional API that makes requests to this database

Once properly set up and running, the user can utilize their desired API testing tool, such as Insomnia or Postman, to send various HTTP requests to our server, which can modify the MongoDB database.

The user can make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to modify the database. I have attached a video demonstration below for further information.

1. This app is powered by Node.js and MySQL, as a result, make sure those are properly installed and configured before continuing on.
2. Navigate to the root of this repo and run `npm install` in your console/terminal to download all the necessary npm packages.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repo. Within this file, copy and paste the following: 

```md

```
*Alternatively, you can modify the included `.env.EXAMPLE` file to include your username and password*

4. Change the value of `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` to your MySQL user and password respectively. Save these changes.
5. Execute `mysql -u root -p` in your console/terminal.
6. Once succesfully logged in, execute `source db/schema.sql` to create database. Exit when finished.
7. You are now ready to turn on the server by running `npm start` or `npm run watch` for nodemon (to view changes live).

*By default, the server is hosted to `http://localhost:3001/` although the PORT number can be modified by changing the value of the variable `PORT` in `server.js` on `line 13`.*
